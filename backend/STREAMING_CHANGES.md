# Deepgram Streaming API Integration

## Overview
This update replaces the Deepgram batch processing API with their streaming API for real-time speech-to-text transcription. The streaming API starts processing audio as soon as WebRTC VAD detects speech activity, significantly reducing latency.

## Key Changes

### 1. **DeepgramStreamingTranscriber Class** (`services/deepgram_service.py`)
- New class that handles WebSocket connection to Deepgram's streaming API
- Manages real-time audio streaming and transcript events
- Supports interim results for even lower latency feedback
- Handles connection lifecycle (connect, send audio, finalize, disconnect)

### 2. **AudioStreamHandler Updates** (`handlers/audio_stream_handler.py`)
- Integrated streaming transcription that starts immediately when speech is detected
- Removed the 200ms prefetch mechanism (no longer needed with streaming)
- Audio is streamed to Deepgram in real-time as it arrives
- Falls back to batch API if streaming fails

## How It Works

1. **Speech Detection**: WebRTC VAD detects speech activity
2. **Immediate Streaming**: As soon as speech starts, a connection to Deepgram streaming API is established
3. **Real-time Processing**: Audio frames are sent to Deepgram as they arrive
4. **Continuous Transcription**: Deepgram processes audio in real-time, providing interim results
5. **Finalization**: When VAD detects speech end (~800ms silence), the transcript is finalized
6. **LLM Processing**: Final transcript is immediately sent to the LLM

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced Latency**: Transcription starts immediately instead of waiting for speech to end
- **Parallel Processing**: STT happens in parallel with speech, not after
- **Better UX**: Faster response times for more natural conversation flow
- **Fail Fast**: No slow fallbacks - issues are immediately apparent

## Configuration

The streaming API uses the same Deepgram API key from your `.env` file. No additional configuration needed.

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the streaming connection:
```bash
python3 test_streaming.py
```

## Error Handling

The system now fails fast if streaming is unavailable:
- If Deepgram streaming connection fails, an error is sent to the frontend
- No fallback to batch API - ensures consistent low-latency behavior
- Clear error messages help diagnose issues (e.g., invalid API key)
